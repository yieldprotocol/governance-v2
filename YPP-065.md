# Proposal
Lower the dust levels

# Background
The dust (min debt) level for USDC and DAI borrowing is set to 5000 (USD VALUE) currently, which now too high to incentivize smaller vaults. Liquidating a vault costs $20 USD at 13 Gwei.

# Details
The [updateDust.ts](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/3b3425137007ea5c81e7466099ea3b187db3343c/scripts/governance/updateDust/updateDust.ts) script will be used, with this input:
```

// Input data: baseId, ilkId, line, dust, dec
export const newDebtMin: Array<[string, string, number]> = [
  [DAI, ETH, 1000],
  [DAI, USDC, 1000], // Via ETH
  [DAI, WBTC, 1000], // Via ETH
  [DAI, LINK, 1000],
  [DAI, FRAX, 1000],
  [DAI, UNI, 1000],
  [DAI, WSTETH, 1000],
  [DAI, ENS, 1000],
  [USDC, ETH, 1000],
  [USDC, DAI, 1000], // Via ETH
  [USDC, WBTC, 1000], // Via ETH
  [USDC, LINK, 1000],
  [USDC, FRAX, 1000],
  [USDC, UNI, 1000],
  [USDC, WSTETH, 1000],
  [USDC, ENS, 1000],
  [ETH, USDC, 1],
  [ETH, DAI, 1],
  [ETH, WBTC, 1],
  [ETH, LINK, 1],
  [ETH, FRAX, 1],
  [ETH, UNI, 1],
  [ETH, WSTETH, 1],
  [ETH, ENS, 1],
]

/// @notice Limits to be used in an auction
/// @param base identifier (bytes6 tag)
/// @param Minimum vault debt, modified by decimals
export const newAuctionMin: Array<[string, number]> = [
  [ETH, 1000000],
  [DAI, 1000],
  [USDC, 1000],
  [WBTC, 500],
  [WSTETH, 1000000],
  [LINK, 138],
  [ENS, 64],
  [UNI, 153],
  [FRAX, 1000],
]
```
# Testing
The change has been tested on a mainnet fork and a Tenderly fork by running [updateDust.ts](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/3b3425137007ea5c81e7466099ea3b187db3343c/scripts/governance/updateDust/updateDust.ts) first, followed by [updateDust.test.ts](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/3b3425137007ea5c81e7466099ea3b187db3343c/scripts/governance/updateDust/updateDust.test.ts) to verify that the changes were made.
