# Proposal

Send the strategy tokens in the timelock to affected users of the DAI/USDC June/December strategies on Arbitrum.
Transactions with chunks of 250 transfers will be used until all transfers are complete.

# Background

To distribute strategy tokens to affected users from [this incident](https://medium.com/yield-protocol/post-mortem-of-incident-on-august-5th-2022-7bb70dbb9ada), the following steps will be taken in this proposal:

1. The timelock will distribute YSDAI6MJD strategy tokens to users\*
2. The timelock will distribute YSUSDC6MJD strategy tokens to users\*

\*_based on the user's strategy token balance when the incident occurred, and relative to the corresponding new strategy's total value_

# Details

The [sendTokens](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/feat/arbitrum-dec-strategy-token-disperse/scripts/governance/emergency/restoreStrategies/sendTokens.ts) script will be used to send DAI/USDC June/December strategy tokens from the timelock to affected users. The script will be called with the specific chunk of transfers to be used.
