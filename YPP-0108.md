# Proposal
Add Assert.sol as a Ladle integration on Mainnet and Arbitrum

# Background

Generally, interaction with the protocol is done through a set of encoded transactions sent to the Ladle (via the batch() function). These transactions each run in isolation and and have no notion of the overall intent of the interaction. This means that incorrectly structured transaction sets could potentially 'succeed', but not have the intended result.    

This integration adds the ability to check if a ladle batch transaction meets an arbitrary expected outcome. An call to Assert.sol (deployed at  0x40f0b18C7A41C04F848C033eD7F9178D9c5A80d8 ) is added to the batch (typically at the end), if the assertion fails, so does the entire batch.

# Testing

Testing was done on a tenderly fork:

Manual verification of state changes on Arbitrum can be seen on this fork [this tenderly fork](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/Yield/v2/fork/2c063048-b86a-4b52-95e1-77857426f54a
