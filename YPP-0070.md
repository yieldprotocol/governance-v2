# Proposal
Enable Notional fCash as a collateral for ETH, DAI and USDC loans, for the December 2022 and March 2023 maturities.

# Background
Notional Finance allows fixed rate borrowing and lending, as does the Yield Protocol. There is an opportunity for arbitrage and leverage by integrating both platforms. Enabling fCash as collateral for DAI and USDC, for June and September 2022, resulted in increases in excess of $3M TVL.


# Details
Notional fCash is already enabled as a collateral, and with this proposal we are deploying new Joins and integrating new maturities.

The fCash maturities that will be accepted as collateral will be those for which a similar Yield series exists. FCash will be accepted as collateral to borrow only its underlying, with a collateralization ratio of 110%.

Steps:
1. [New fCash Joins](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/87b3939dabe4167b9c4c38c5634cd2e2405c17e4/scripts/governance/addFCashCollateral/deployNotionalJoins.ts)
2. [Integration of new fCash maturities](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/87b3939dabe4167b9c4c38c5634cd2e2405c17e4/scripts/governance/addFCashCollateral/addFCashMaturities/addFCashMaturities.ts)
