# Proposal

Add WETH Rewards for YSETH6MJD for the month of December.

# Background

Our strategies have a built-in capability to distribute rewards that hasn't been tested yet on mainnet. The outgoing v1 strategies offer a good opportunity to do some real life testing.

# Details

Here are the steps:

1. Set WETH as the rewards token, and set YSETH6MJD to distribute 10 ETH over the month of December.

Script that performed said actions: https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/0494d4e9131a8f6ab6eba13ff085e3e8f0e16f58/scripts/governance/add/addRewards/addEthRewards/addEthRewards.ts

Configuration applied:

```typescript
export const rewardsData: Array<[string, string, number, number, number]> = [
  // strategyId, rewardsTokenAddress, rewards start, rewards stop, rewards rate
  [YSETH6MJD, assets.getOrThrow(ETH)!, 1669852800, 1672531199, 3733573675916],
]
```

The contracts have been deployed to Arbitrum mainnet and the proposal sent to the multisig.

# Testing

We'll do testing on mainnet. YOLO.
