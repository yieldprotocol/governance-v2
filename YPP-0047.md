# Proposal
Give permission to the multisig to `execute` and `restore` on the Cloak (EmergencyBrake), bypassing the Timelock. Both on Mainnet and Arbitrum.

# Background
Developers currently have permission to `execute` emergency plans to isolate contracts, but the permission to `restore` them has only been given to the Timelock, meaning that a governance proposal with a timelock delay is required to `restore` a contract. Past experiences show that this makes us less ready to isolate contracts and put the protocol in a safe situation, incurring undue risks.

`execute` permissions on the Cloak are also being given to the multisig, just in case.

# Details
The multisig addresses are `0xd659565b84bcfcb23b02ee13e46cb51429f4558a` and `0x7237963EED1809976A0928A42f5d6f529E0Df584` for mainnet and arbitrum respectively. The signatures for `execute(bytes32)` and `restore(bytes32)` are `0xe751f271` and `0x205e8d53` respectively. [Proof](https://sig.eth.samczsun.com).

# Testing
The change has been deployed on a [tenderly mainnet fork](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/Yield/v2/fork/2059ec16-8f51-4c7e-82d8-82405f0187a5/simulation/dbdbdbf9-8f75-4e31-b4cc-38a043105c11) and [tenderly arbitrum fork](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/Yield/v2/fork/25a21fa7-f683-4270-82a4-41d79b69feb0/simulation/bf8c05aa-6cf8-4194-8582-9826f164a8b6). The events on the `execute` transaction show which permissions were given. The state change diff shows there is nothing else in the proposal.
