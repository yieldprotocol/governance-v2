# Proposal

Send the [recovered DAI and USDC](https://medium.com/yield-protocol/post-mortem-of-incident-on-august-5th-2022-7bb70dbb9ada) in the timelock to @alcueca at `0xC7aE076086623ecEA2450e364C838916a043F9a8`.

# Background

To distribute strategy tokens to affected users from [this incident](https://medium.com/yield-protocol/post-mortem-of-incident-on-august-5th-2022-7bb70dbb9ada), the following steps will be taken:

1. Send the recovered DAI and USDC to @alcueca at `0xC7aE076086623ecEA2450e364C838916a043F9a8`
2. @alcueca will invest in each **NEW** strategy with the funds from step 1
3. @alcueca will send the strategy tokens (both YSDAI6MJD and YSUSDC6MJD) to the timelock
4. The timelock will distribute YSDAI6MJD strategy tokens to users\*
5. The timelock will distribute YSUSDC6MJD strategy tokens to users\*

**This proposal is only for step 1 above.** Items 4 and 5 will use separate proposals.

\*_based on the user's strategy token balance when the incident occurred, and relative to the corresponding new strategy's total value_
