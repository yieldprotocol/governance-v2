# Proposal
Activate the DAI, USDC, ETH and FRAX December series on mainnet using yieldspace-tv, and roll the respective strategies from June to December

# Background
On June 24th 2022 all June series matured, and the YSDAI6MMS, YSUSDC6MMS, YSETH6MMS and YSFRAX6MMs strategies stopped accruing fees. New yieldspace-tv pools are going to be used for the December series, with eTokens as a yield-bearing token to provide extra returns to LPs.

# Details
Here are the steps:
1. Deploy fyToken contracts for FYDAI2212, FYUSDC2212, FYETH2212 and FYFRAX2212 (no need for governance approval)
2. Deploy respective pool contracts (no need for governance approval). FRAX won't use an underlying Euler token.
3. Governance proposal
    1. Add new series
    2. Add ilks to the new series
    3. Initialize new pools
    4. Roll the strategies to the next pool

We would be deploying the fyTokens & pools using the [add script link](), with [add config link]():

```
Manually copy contents of the config file. Make sure they are fully explained with natspec.
```
