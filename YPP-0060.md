# Proposal

Add spot oracles to the Cauldron so that all assets can be priced in ETH

# Background

The Solvency contract sources oracles from the Cauldron to price all protocol assets and redeemable fyToken in ETH terms. A few extra oracles need to be set up. This doesn't make any assets into collaterals or bases, and doesn't change the collateral ratio of any existing pairs.

# Details

The summary of the execution is as follows:

1. Governance proposal
   a. Add some of the existing oracles as sources in the CompositeMultiOracle for the missing pairs
   b. Add some additional paths in CompositeMultiOracle
   c. Add the CompositeMultiOracle as the spotOracle for the missing pairs, with 200% as the collateralization ratio
