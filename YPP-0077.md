# Proposal
Enable Witch v2 on Arbitrum for all positions, and disable Witch v1 for all positions.

# Background

Witch v2 is a more powerful and configurable liquidation engine than Witch v1. The math has been simplified to remove rounding errors, the limits have been changed to reduce risks and match the Cauldron. Payment with fyTokens is now possible. Partial liquidations are also possible.

# Details

In this proposal Witch V2 will be allowed to liquidate all positions. Some series and underlying/collateral pairs were already available to Witch v2 and won't be configured again. Witch v1 will be disabled by setting maximum concurrent collateral under auction to zero for all collaterals.

1. Governance proposal
   2. Orchestrate Witch v2 with the DAI series, ETH Join and USDC Join.
   3. Set auction parameters for ETH/DAI, ETH/USDC, USDC/DAI and USDC/ETH
   4. Protect Witch v1 from liquidations
