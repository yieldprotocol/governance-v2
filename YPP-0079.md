# Proposal

Deploy a strategy lever which allows user to create a leveraged position of strategy token

# Background

The StrategyLever builds on Strategy tokens as collateral to allow leveraged LP positions. While the spread between LP returns and fyToken borrowing rates are unlikely to be very attractive for users right now, this allows us to bootstrap liquidity on the pools at a low cost. Building up liquidity unlocks other features such as stEthLever and CrabLever.

# Details

In this proposal we are going to deploy [Giver](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/vault-v2/blob/master/packages/foundry/contracts/utils/Giver.sol) & [StrategyLever](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/yvarb/blob/47044e8c939d58e997b2c887c6b31a24792f6697/contracts/YieldStrategyLever.sol) and orchestrate them to give relevant permissions.

Steps:

1. Deploy giver (no need for governance approval)
2. Orchestrate giver
   1. Grant permission on `Cauldron` for `give` to the `Giver`
   2. Grant permission on `Giver` for `banIlk` to the `Timelock`
   3. Remove `ROOT` permission for the deployer on `Giver`
3. Deploy StrategyLever (no need for governance approval)
4. Orchestrate Strategy Lever
   1. Grant permission on `Giver` for `give` to the lever
   2. Grant permission on `Giver` for `seize` to the lever
5. Set flashFee factor for joins & fyTokens
