# Proposal

Increase the dust amd max levels for FCash.

# Background

The maximum borrow for fCash's USDC/FUSDC and DAI/FDAI borrowing pairs was previously set at 500k USDC. This limit was quickly reached in the USDC/FUSDC pair. We plan to raise this limit to 1000000 (1 million) USDC. Similarily, we will raise the DAI limit to the same amount.

Also, the dust level for fCAsh FUSDC was set to 5000 (USD value). We will lower it to 1000. This was level was previoulsy lowered for all other borrowing pairs (YPP-0086). 

(The limits for ETH/FETH were correct and will not be changed)

# Details

The [updateLimits.ts](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/pull/293/files#diff-eff1c2a858cba3323fcc396b80daa2aad677ce28500f9825ddcf7a4e1bc29856) script will be used, with this input:
```
/// @notice Limits to be used in an auction
/// @param base identifier (bytes6 tag)
/// @param ilk identifier (bytes6 tag)
/// @param Maximum global debt allowed for this pair, modified by decimals
/// @param Minimum vault debt allowed for this pair, modified by decimals
/// @param Decimals to append to global and vault debt.
export const newLimits: Array<[string, string, number, number, number]> = [
  [DAI, FDAI2303, 1000000, 1000, 18],
  [DAI, FDAI2306, 1000000, 1000, 18],
  [USDC, FDAI2303, 1000000, 1000, 6],
  [USDC, FDAI2306, 1000000, 1000, 6],
]
