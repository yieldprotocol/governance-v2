# Proposal
Give developer roles to 0x1Bd3Abb6ef058408734EA01cA81D325039cd7bcA, controlled by @brucedonovan.

# Background
The frontend team doesn't have access to propose and execute and that is a bottleneck in governance. Developers can propose and execute governance proposals, but not approve them. Developers can also execute emergency plans, but not register them or restore permissions.

# Details

The (addDevelopers)[https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/main/scripts/governance/addDevelopers/addDevelopers.ts] script will be used, with (this input)[https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/main/scripts/governance/addDevelopers/addDevelopers.mainnet.config.ts].

```
export const newDevelopers: string[] = [
    '0x1Bd3Abb6ef058408734EA01cA81D325039cd7bcA',
]
```
