# Proposal

Deploy & configure contracts needed by Contango. 

# Background

Contango exchange uses fixed rate markets to synthesise expirable futures.
In order to allow for a smoother interaction, Yield will deploy a set of contracts specially tailored for Contango.
This is the first proposal (out of 3) that'll allow for the full integration with Contango.

# Details

Here are the steps:

1. Deploy a separate Cauldron (no need for governance approval)
2. Deploy a specialised Ladle (no need for governance approval)
3. Deploy the composite oracle (no need for governance approval)
4. Deploy the identity oracle (no need for governance approval)
5. Governance proposal
   1. Configure Cauldron permissions
   2. Configure Ladle permissions
   3. Configure CompositeOracle permissions
