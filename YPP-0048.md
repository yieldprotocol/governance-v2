# Proposal
Set pool fees to zero on all mainnet pools.

# Background
A bug in the pool contract code makes the fees work in reverse. We are setting them to zero to stay in a valid state, while a better solution is investigated.

# Details
```
export const poolFees: Array<[string, number]> = [
  [FYETH2212, 0],
  [FYDAI2212, 0],
  [FYUSDC2212, 0],
]
```

# Testing
The change has been deployed on tenderly [mainnet fork](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/Yield/v2/fork/e9583153-e45d-4d42-a3c4-9fd8cf4ec2cd/simulation/11c637df-2d51-4379-8907-9e08fea1053e).
