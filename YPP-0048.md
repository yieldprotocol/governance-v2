# Proposal
Set pool fees to zero on all mainnet pools.

# Background
A bug in the pool contract code makes the fees work in reverse. We are setting them to zero to stay in a valid state, while a better solution is investigated.

# Details

# Testing
The change has been deployed on tenderly mainnet fork []().
