# Proposal
Activate the DAI, USDC, ETH and FRAX March series on mainnet using yieldspace-tv, and roll the respective strategies (YSETH6MMS, YSDAI6MMS, YSUSDC6MMS, YSFRAX6MMS) from September to March.

# Background 
On September 22nd 2022 all September series matured, and the strategies stopped accruing fees. New yieldspace-tv pools are going to be used for the March series.

# Details
The steps are: 
    1. Deploy new fyTokens, Euler pools and Non-tv pools.
    2. Activate the March series
    3. Governance proposal
          i. Orchestrate pools
         ii. Add new series
        iii. Add ilks to the new series
         iv. Initialize new pools
          v. Roll the strategies to the next pool
